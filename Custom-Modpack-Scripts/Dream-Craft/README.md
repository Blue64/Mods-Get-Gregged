===== DreamCraft =====
=====================================================

Version 1.7.4.0 BETA is out (27.01.2015)

A GregTech-based modpack with magical Mods like Thaumcraft and its addons, Witchery and Frobidden magic.

I change most of the Recepies to make the pack very hard and try to balance and Tier the mods in the Pack. 
For example you have to kill a Naga first (Twilight Forest) to start with Thaumcraft(Basic Wand). 
If you want to building a ME System you need Titanium...
