ArchCraft's Scripts

Those scripts were originally supposed to be used only on my server, but due to circumstances, I choose to add them here.

The recipes are "hard", if recipes can be and definately expensive. As items from a few mods other than GT are used sometimes, and since they sometimes differ a lot from the originals, I figured I'd warn you. This might not be for everyone. (I think they're still worth a look. ;P)
